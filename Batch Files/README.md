"Dump Videos.bat" is used to offload videos to my phone and server. Actions depend on computer being used.

"Duplicate REPO Save.bat" is because I am bad at the game and didn't want to reset to level one if I died.

"File Selector Template.bat" opens a file browsing window so you can select a file. It then displays some details about the selected file. Useful for selecting a file for processing graphically instead of CLI.
