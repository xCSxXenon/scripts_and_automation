This is for formatting removable storage for client data, usually a flash drive.

Asks for a drive letter, client name, and a computer #. Formats given volume letter as exFAT, gives it an icon, and creates an autorun file so it displays the provided name and ID number. Asks to eject it afterwards with RemoveDrive.exe

exFAT is used since flash drives were 99% of my use-case. With actual drives, this would still be used so the storage worked on Windows and Mac OS systems.
